Employees State Insurance (ESI) is a government mandated health insurance for employees. It is mandatory for organisations with more than 20 employees, whose monthly salary is lower than ₹21,000. RazorpayX Payroll now supports end-to-end automation for multi-location ESIC compliance, eliminating the need for manual handling or dependency on external CA partners.

<Warning>
  **Watch Out!**

  Payroll does not support initial ESI registration at the organisation level, only individual employee registration is available. To register your organisation on the ESIC Portal, please follow [the registration guide](https://portal.esic.gov.in/ESICInsurance1/ESICInsurancePortal/Employer_Employee_registration_through_portal.pdf).
</Warning>

## What is Multi-Location ESIC?

Organisations with employees spread across multiple states or locations are required by ESIC to:

* Register each office location under a separate sub-code.
* Maintain distinct login credentials for each location.
* Generate location-specific contribution files.
* Process payments separately for each sub-code.

<Warning>
  **Watch Out!**

  Please note that multiple locations can share the same subcode, but each location must be distinctly identified. Hence, location mapping must be done with extreme care and precision. This is MANDATORY for all ESIC configurations.
</Warning>

With our Multi-location ESIC feature, you can now automate the entire workflow through a single dashboard eleminitating the need for manual intervention as well as external CA support.

**Key Benefits**

* Automated, state-wise contribution file generation.
* Location based employee registration and payment processing.
* You can register each office location under a separate sub-code.
* Streamlined operations with smart batch processing.

## Employee Office Location Assignment

For multi-location ESIC to work correctly, each eligible employee must be assigned to the appropriate office location.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For New Employees">
    When adding a new employee:

    1. Office location is a mandatory field in the new onboarding flow. Be very careful while adding your location as you cannot change or delete it afterwards.
    2. Select the appropriate office location for the employee.
    3. Based on the selected location, automation will:

    * Use the corresponding ESIC sub-code and credentials.
    * Register the employee in the correct ESIC portal.
    * Update the employee profile with the registration details.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="For Existing Employees">
    To update existing employees:

    1. Go to the employee's profile.
    2. You cannot update existing locations - [contact us](mailto:xpayroll@razorpay.com) for assistance in updating an existing location.
    3. Save the changes.
  </Tab>

## ESIC Registration Process

The system automatically handles employee registration based on their assigned office location:
Based on the screenshots, here's the refined documentation for the ESIC registration process:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="For Employees Without IP Number">
    When an employee doesn't have an existing ESIC IP number:

    1. Navigate to **People** → Select the employee → **ESI Registration.**
    2. Select **No** when asked "Does \[Employee Name] have a ESIC IP Number?"
    3. Fill in all required information:
       * Bank account details and proof (cancelled cheque/passbook)
       * Personal details (DOJ, mobile, photo, PAN)
       * Address information (present and permanent)
       * Nominee details
       * Dispensary selection
       * Family member details (if applicable)
    4. Click **Request ESIC Addition.**

    Once this is done, the system retrieves the office location, ESIC sub-code and nearest dispensary from the employee profile. It also:

    * Retrieves the matching credentials for that sub-code/office location.
    * Logs into the ESIC portal using those credentials.
    * Registers the employee under that organisation.
    * Retrieves the IP number and updates the employee record.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="For Employees With Existing IP Number">
    When an employee already has an ESIC IP number from previous employment:

    1. Navigate to **People** → Select the employee → **ESI Registration.**
    2. Select **Yes** when asked "Does \[Employee Name] have a ESIC IP Number?"
    3. Enter the existing **ESIC IP** number in the field provided.
    4. Fill in the same required information(bank details, personal information and so on).
    5. Click **Request ESIC Addition.**

    Once done, the system verifies the existing IP number. It then registers the employee under your organisation using the appropriate sub-code credentials.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Contribution File Generation

Once multi-location ESIC is configured, contribution files are automatically generated for each location:

1. The system calculates ESIC contributions as usual.
2. Employees are segregated based on their office location.
3. Separate contribution files with their contribution details are generated for each sub-code/office location.
4. Files are formatted according to government specifications for direct upload.

## Payment Processing

When multi-location ESIC is enabled, the payment automation process works as follows:

1. System identifies that multi-location is enabled.
2. Processes payments one sub-code/office location at a time:
   * Selects a sub-code.
   * Fetches all employees tagged to that location.
   * Retrieves the credentials for that sub-code/office location.
   * Logs in and processes the payment.
3. Repeats the process for all configured sub-codes/office locations.
4. Updates the dashboard with payment status for each location.

    Yes. You can add new office locations at any time through the Company Details section.
  </Accordion>

    Update the employee's office location in their profile. The system will automatically use the correct sub-code for future compliance activities.
  </Accordion>
