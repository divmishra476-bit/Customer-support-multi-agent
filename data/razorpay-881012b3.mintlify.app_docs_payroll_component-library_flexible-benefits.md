# Flexible Benefits

> Set up and manage Flexi Benefit Plan (FBP) components in Payroll to give employees tax-friendly compensation choices.

The **Flexi Component Library** in Payroll lets you define and manage Flexible Benefit Plan (FBP) components. These components allow employees to allocate a portion of their CTC toward tax-friendly benefits such as Meal Allowance, Car Lease Reimbursement, Employer NPS Contribution and other custom benefits.

Each flexi component is configured once at the organisation level and can then be added to an employee's compensation. Employees can either declare an amount of their choice (within the limit) or have the maximum eligible amount auto-applied, depending on how the component is set up.
