You can provide salary advances to your employees on the Payroll Dashboard.

Payroll automates the salary advance process. We settle the advance amount against future payroll executions via monthly deductions. You can also customise the EMIs so that the employee pays the advance over several months.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is Advance Salary different from Employee Loans?">
    In a salary advance, the organisation pays a portion of the employee's salary as an advance. The advance paid is recovered in instalments from the employee and is usually interest-free.

    [Employee loans](/docs/payroll/loans) are a loan facility employers provide to their employees at a lower interest rate than the market rate. The EMIs are deducted from the employee's salary and on Payroll, you can modify the employee's EMI or skip the EMI when necessary.
