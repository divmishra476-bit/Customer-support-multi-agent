As a Service Partner, you can invite your affiliates to use Razorpay Payments products and RazorpayX powered Current Account. You get a partnership commission when the Sub-merchants perform any transaction using Razorpay products. Know more about [partnership commission](/docs/partners/commissions).

<Info>
  **Handy Tips**

  You can invite your clients to use Razorpay payments. To become a Sub-merchant, the invitee has to accept the invite and create a Razorpay account.
</Info>

## Who is a Sub-merchant

Sub-merchants are the merchants who get onboarded on the Razorpay platform by a Partner. For example, *Acme* wants to provide an order management solution for its client company "Gekko". In this scenario, "Gekko" is Acme's Sub-merchant.

Once onboarded, Sub-merchant accounts (Affiliate accounts) must be activated to start collecting or disbursing payments.

You can invite your Affiliate partners/Sub-merchants directly using the Dashboard. You can also encourage businesses to sign up for Razorpay products by sharing referral links on social media and instant messengers.

## Add Sub-merchants Using Email Id

You can invite Sub-merchants using their email id to sign up and register on Razorpay. You can send an invite link to an individual account or multiple accounts.

<Info>
  **Handy Tips**

  You can send a maximum of 1,00,000 invites/day. This could be individual invites, bulk invites or a combination of both.

    | Not Submitted       | When you invite the Sub-merchant, and your affiliate account is successfully added, the activation status by default is `Not submitted`. This is the default status.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
