Documents and letters are necessary for payroll purposes and in the process of maintaining Human Resource Information System (HRIS). On Payroll, you, your team and employees can view documents and others as applicable.

## View Documents Uploaded by Employees

To view all the documents uploaded by employees:

1. Log in to your [Payroll Dashboard](https://payroll.razorpay.com/dashboard).
2. Go to **Reports** → **Documents**.
3. In the table available under **Documents Report**, you can view the type of documents uploaded, by whom and when and any description provided for it.

## Delete Documents

You can also delete documents on Payroll. To delete documents:

1. Log in to your [Payroll Dashboard](https://payroll.razorpay.com/dashboard).
2. In **Reports** → **Documents** → **Documents Report** table, click on the employee's name. It opens up the employee's profile.
3. In the right pane, click on **View Documents**.
4. On the Documents page that appears with the table, look at the type of document and choose which document you want to delete.

If you are an admin and wish to delete **Common Organisation Documents**, they are available to you in the **Documents** section on the left menu.

## Create Common Organisation Documents

You can keep common organisation documents publicly available to all the internal members of your company. Documents like HR and leave policy, code of conduct and more must be internally available. To make such documents visible for the entire organisation:

1. Log in to your [Payroll Dashboard](https://payroll.razorpay.com/dashboard).
2. Go to **Documents**, and from the drop-down, select **Common Organisation Documents**.
3. Give a proper description, and upload the document (PDF preferably).

This document immediately becomes visible to all your employees and on their Dashboards. You can add more documents by repeating this procedure. If you delete any such document, then it is removed for all employees as well.

<Warning>
  **Watch Out!**

  Only administrators and user roles who have been specifically granted this permission can upload common documents. Know more about [Payment Pages](/docs/payments/payment-pages) user permissions in Payroll.
</Warning>

## Manage Templates

You can upload your templates to your account on the Payroll Dashboard.

1. Log in to the [Payroll Dashboard](https://payroll.razorpay.com/dashboard).
2. In **Quick Links**, click **Generate/edit letters**.
3. Click **Add Letter** from the right pane and add your templates.
