You can whitelist Razorpay-issued SSL certificates and IP addresses to communicate with Razorpay APIs and Webhooks. By downloading Razorpay SSL certificates and whitelisting our IPs, you can verify that you are securely communicating with our servers.

## SSL Certificates

<Info>
  **Update (September 2026):** Razorpay no longer publishes new SSL certificate files. The table below is provided for historical reference only, with X10 being the last certificate published. Do not pin these certificates.

  For the current SSL certificate policy, including certificate pinning, root certificates, certificate changes, verification steps and FAQs, see the [Guidelines for SSL Certificate Rotation](/docs/security/whitelists/guidelines-ssl-cert-rotation).
</Info>

Past SSL certificates for `api.razorpay.com`, along with their validity periods, are listed below.

| Certificate File                                                                                                                                                    | Valid From       | Expiry           |

These files applied to past rotations only. Do not pin or whitelist them for new integrations.

<Warning>
  **Watch Out!**

  We highly discourage pinning our SSL certificate to your applications. If your internal policy mandates pinning, pin all the root CA certificates listed on the [Guidelines for SSL Certificate Rotation](/docs/security/whitelists/guidelines-ssl-cert-rotation) page, not the certificate files above. Otherwise, use the [latest CA Bundle](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) provided by your OS.
</Warning>

## API IPs

Requests to Razorpay APIs should be routed to `api.razorpay.com`. This will be resolved to various IPs controlled by our load balancers. However, if the IPs to which the requests should be sent are restricted, all your API requests can be routed to `prod-api-static.razorpay.com`. This will be resolved to any of the following IPs:

```javascript API Ingress IPs theme={null}
52.66.140.48
52.66.140.61
13.235.207.57
13.232.63.19
13.234.135.6
13.234.83.3 
13.235.208.84
13.235.96.132
15.206.46.184
18.99.160.48/29
```

<Info>
  **Handy Tips**

  * `18.99.160.0/29` is a CIDR range. All the IPs in the range `18.99.160.48 - 18.99.160.55` are utilised.

  * All our SDKs use proper DNS caching and honour the TTLs that we set. However, if you are not using our SDKs, ensure that DNS TTLs set by Razorpay are honoured and are not cached aggressively.
</Info>

## Webhook IPs

Below is the list of IPs from which Webhooks are sent from our servers.

```javascript Egress IPs theme={null}
52.66.75.174    
52.66.76.63 
52.66.151.218
35.154.217.40
35.154.22.73
35.154.143.15
13.126.199.247
13.126.238.192
13.232.194.134
18.96.225.0/26
18.99.161.0/26
```

<Info>
  **Handy Tips**

  `18.96.225.0/26` and `18.99.161.0/26` are CIDR ranges. All the IPs in the range `18.96.225.0 - 18.96.225.63` and `18.99.161.0 - 18.99.161.63` are utilised for sending the webhooks.
</Info>

We highly recommend using [Webhook Signature](/docs/webhooks#validation) to validate the integrity of the webhooks, even if you have whitelisted our Webhook IPs.

## UAT Static IPs

Below is the list of UAT egress IPs.

```javascript UAT Egress IPs theme={null}
52.66.76.68
52.66.95.207
13.127.201.109
```
