  <Accordion title="Why is there a misalignment issue when printing directly?">
    The misalignment issue may occur due to the paper size not matching the printed content, causing the alignment to be off. This can happen because:

    1. The `directprint` value in the registry is set, preventing the print pop-up from launching.
    2. The printer configurations on the system are incorrect.
    3. The printer model, such as a POS 8c printer, may require specific settings to ensure proper alignment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the printer alignment issue?">
    To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

    1. **Clear the `directprint` value in the registry:** This ensures that the print pop-up appears, allowing proper configuration before printing.
    2. **Check and correct the system's printer configurations:** Ensure that the paper size and scaling settings are accurate.
    3. **Use a POS 8c printer if available:** Adjust the datatype to **NT EMF 1.008** to ensure the image scales and fits correctly on the paper.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the issue with the secondary screen during checkout?">
    On checkout, the pop-up window displays the phone number correctly on the primary screen, but the secondary screen shows an incorrect message ("share your number for a digital bill") instead of the phone number.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the issue with the secondary screen not displaying the phone number?">
    The issue can be resolved by adjusting the code to account for screen resolution differences between the primary and secondary screens. For example:

    * **Primary screen resolution:** 1024x768
    * **Secondary screen resolution:** 600x800
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the &#x22;Failed to generate OTP for Razorpay EDC linking&#x22; error occur after running Upgrade.exe?">
    This issue arises when the "Generate OTP" function in BillMeSettings is used after running Upgrade.exe. The error is likely caused by an incorrect configuration of the `DNSResolver` registry value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the OTP generation issue?">
    To resolve this error, ensure the registry value for **DNSResolver** is correctly configured:

    * Set the value to **0** (default setting).
    * Only set it to **1** if using MCD functionality.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the pop-up window show an empty text box instead of the previously used phone number during a transaction?">
    This issue occurs when the system fails to auto-copy the previously used phone number into the pop-up text box. It may be caused by an incorrect configuration of the `NoExtractorFileType` registry value.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the auto-copy issue?">
    To resolve this problem, ensure the registry value for `NoExtractorFileType` is set correctly. Set it to **"txt"** instead of **"raw"**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does the printed thermal copy show misalignment or cut off text on the right side?">
    This issue occurs due to incorrect page dimension settings in the thermal printer configuration, causing the printed content to misalign or get truncated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the thermal print alignment issue?">
    To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to the `tpdps.gpd` file located in: `C:\Windows\System32\spool\drivers\x64\3`
    2. Open the file and adjust the **PageDimensions** for the **ThermalReceipt** setting.
    3. Experiment with new values for the page dimensions until the alignment is correct.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the printer incorrectly printing multiple copies during transactions?">
    This issue occurs due to improper configuration of the **BMAuto** and **WhiteList** settings, leading to unintended printing behaviour.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the BMAuto setup issue?">
    To resolve the problem, configure the following settings correctly:

    1. Set **BMAuto** to **2.**
    2. Set **BMCopies** to **0.**
    3. Set **WhiteList** to **1.**
    4. Ensure that the **WhiteListString** is properly defined for tax invoices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why does no print file appear in the print queue when using an Epson printer, and why is the printer paused?">
    This issue occurs because the printer’s print processor is not correctly configured to match the required `PrintDataType` format, causing the printer to pause and fail to process print jobs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the hardware print issue with the Epson printer?">
    To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

    1. Navigate to **Printer Properties** for the Epson printer.
    2. Go to the **Advanced Tab** and select **Print Processor.**
    3. Set the print processor to **NT EMF 1.008** to match the registry settings.
       This adjustment ensures compatibility between the printer and the configured data type, allowing print jobs to appear in the queue and process correctly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is the total amount displayed incorrectly on the secondary screen (for example, 3000.00 appears as 300000.00)?">
    This issue arises due to improper parsing of the total amount string, likely caused by incorrect spacing or formatting in the registry values for **MBILLPAY** and **FBILLPAY.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the total amount parsing issue on the secondary screen?">
    To resolve this issue, verify and adjust the registry values:

    1. Check the **MBILLPAY** and **FBILLPAY** registry settings.
    2. Ensure that proper spacing and formatting are included in the parsed strings.
       Setting up the correct registry value with all the spaces from the txt file resolves this issue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are PDF files improperly formatted during printing, leading to incorrect paper usage?">
    This issue occurs when there is a mismatch between the paper size settings in **BillMe** and the default printer, causing the PDF to print with incorrect formatting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the paper size mismatch issue?">
    To resolve this problem, align the paper size settings:

    1. Open the **Printer Properties** for the default printer.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why are transactions uploaded as CW instead of BM or BM+Print when files are moved or deleted from the upload/queued folder?">
    This issue occurs when the number of files in the upload/queued folder exceeds the preconfigured limit, causing the system to incorrectly upload transactions as CW rather than BM or BM+Print.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the issue of suspicious transactions due to file count limits?">
    To resolve this, adjust the **FileLimit** registry value. Increase the **FileLimit** from **10** to **11** or **12** to accommodate more files per transaction.
    This adjustment will prevent transactions from being incorrectly uploaded and allow the system to handle a higher number of files.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why do multi-page invoices result in paper cuts after each printed page?">
    This issue occurs when the printer is set to automatically cut the paper after each page, which causes the paper cuts between pages when printing multi-page invoices.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How can I fix the issue of paper cuts when printing multi-page invoices?">
    To resolve this, follow these steps:

    1. Enable the **IsMultiPageInvoice** registry setting by setting it to **1.**
