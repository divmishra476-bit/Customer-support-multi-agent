When managing payroll, organisations need consistent salary frameworks across employee groups, some require basic structures, while others need complex multi-component setups. In Payroll, you can create both simple and advanced salary structures to match your organisation's compensation strategy.

Salary Structures in Payroll is a template-based system that standardises employee compensation packages. It enables you to create reusable salary templates with predefined component breakdowns that can be applied to multiple employees. It also ensures consistency in salary calculations and simplifies payroll management.

    | **Template-Based Structures**   | <ul>Admins can create reusable salary templates with predefined component distributions for consistency.</ul> | Earlier, each employee's salary was configured individually, leading to inconsistencies. Now, admins create a 'Sales Team Structure' template and apply it to all sales employees, ensuring uniform component distribution. |
    | **Percentage-Based Components** | <ul>Components can be defined as percentages of CTC.</ul>                                                     | HR teams manually recalculated allowances for every salary revision. Now, with Basic set at 50% of CTC, the system displays an alert to adjust amounts when CTC changes, eliminating faulty calculations.                   |
    | **Residual Component Handling** | <ul>System automatically calculates balancing amounts to ensure components total to 100% of CTC.</ul>         | Finance teams struggled to balance salary components to match exact CTC. Now, the 'Other Allowance' component helps them adjust the residual, ensuring components always total correctly i.e. 100%.                         |
    | **Preview and Validation**      | <ul>Test structures with sample CTCs before implementation to verify calculations.</ul>                       | Errors in component calculations were discovered only after payroll execution.

  <Tab title="Create New Structure">
    A Create New Structure option allows you to build a salary template from scratch with custom component distributions.

    By creating new structures, you can design compensation packages tailored to specific roles, departments or employee levels while maintaining standardisation. You also get to test calculations before implementation.

    To create a new salary structure:

    1. Navigate to **Settings → Salary Structures→ Manage**.
           <img src="https://razorpay.com/docs/build/browser/assets/images/salary-structure-manage.jpg" alt="Salary Structures Manage option highlighted under Component Library in Settings." width="800" />
    2. Click **Add Structure** button in the top-right corner.
    3. Select **Create new** from the dropdown menu.
           <img src="https://razorpay.com/docs/build/browser/assets/images/add-salary-structure.jpg" alt="Add Structure button on the Salary Structures page." width="800" />
    4. Fill in the **General details**:
       * Enter a **Structure name** (must be unique across all structures).
       * Add a **Description** to explain the structure's purpose (for example, 'Salary structure for employees whose income falls below the tax bracket').
       * Click **Next** to proceed.

    4. Fill in the **General details**:
       * Enter a **Structure name** (for example, 'Salary Structure Existing').
       * Add a **Description** (for example, 'Sample salary structure picked from the existing ones').
    5. **Select template**:
       * Choose from the **Salary Structure** dropdown.
       * Select an existing structure (for example, 'Default - Organisation Default').
       * The preview shows the selected template's component breakdown.
       * Review components like Basic (50% of CTC), HRA (25% of CTC) and so on.

    <img src="https://razorpay.com/docs/build/browser/assets/images/create-structure-existing.jpg" alt="Create structure form with Salary Structure template selected and the structure preview shown on the right." width="800" />

    6. Click **Next** to proceed to structure building.
    7. **Modify the structure**:
       * All components from the selected template are pre-filled.
       * Adjust percentages or amounts as needed.
       * Add or remove components using **Add components** button.
       * Preview calculations with sample CTC.
    8. **Create the structure**:
       * Verify all modifications.
       * Click **Create Structure** to save the new template.

    To manage duplicated structures:

    1. View all structures in the main **Salary Structures** page.
    2. Use filters to sort by **Active** or **Disabled** status.

The selected structure will determine the employee's salary breakdown in all future payroll cycles.

<Warning>
  **Watch Out!**

  * Each structure must have a unique name across the organisation.
  * Components from the library maintain their original tax treatments.
  * Changes to active structures don't affect existing employee assignments.
  * Disabled structures remain in the system for historical reference.
  * The preview feature uses the current tax rules for calculations.
  * Residual components ensure mathematical accuracy in salary distribution.
