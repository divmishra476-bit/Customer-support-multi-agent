  <Accordion title="What are settlements?">
    Settlement is the process in which the money received from your customers is settled to your bank account. Settlements for all payments will be done in INR (Indian Rupees), irrespective of the currency in which the payment was made by the customer. Settlement cycle is subject to bank approval and can vary based on your business vertical, risk factor, and so on. Each settlement generated has a unique settlement id attached to it along with the amount settled. Know more about [Settlements](/docs/pos/settlements).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the settlement cycle you offer?">
    Our standard settlement cycle is T+1 working days, T being the date of transaction capture. This means that the captured payments are settled within 1 working days from the date of capture.

      **Handy Tips**

  <Accordion title="How do I check settlements in my bank account?">
    Each settlement has a Unique Transaction Reference (UTR) number, which is provided by our banking partners. You can see this number in the settlement section when you click on a particular settlement id. You can also download **Settlement Reports** from the **Reports** section to view UTR. This is a unique reference number available across banks, which can be used to track a specific settlement in your bank account.
