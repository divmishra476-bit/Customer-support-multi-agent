The Bulk One-Time Payment feature in RazorpayX Payroll enables you to add one-time adhoc earnings, such as bonuses and incentives, for multiple employees at once. Instead of adding a one-time payment for each employee individually, you upload a single template and process the payments for your entire workforce in one operation, saving time and ensuring consistency.

  **Handy Tips**

  Bulk One-Time Payment is available for organisations on Payroll Engine 2.0 and needs to be enabled for your organisation. [Contact Payroll Support](mailto:xpayroll@razorpay.com) for assistance.

## Use Cases

Bulk one-time payments are beneficial when you want to pay adhoc earnings to a group of employees together, such as:

* A performance incentive or other bonuses like a retention or joining bonus.
* Remuneration for an ad hoc project.

<Warning>
  **Watch Out!**

  You must **NOT** use bulk one-time payments for the following:

  * **Not for salary payouts**: Do not make salary payouts using one-time payments, such as running payroll for select employees, disbursing an employee's last salary, paying a skipped salary or clearing outstanding salary arrears. If any salary component is yet to be paid, add it to the immediate next payroll cycle.

  * **Not for compliance payments**: PF, TDS, PT and other compliance components are a part of the payroll process, and you must process them in **Run Payroll**.

  * **Not for paying Advance Salary**: The amount paid to employees using one-time payments gets added to their next gross pay and causes double entries and errors.
</Warning>
